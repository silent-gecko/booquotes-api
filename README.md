# BooQuotes API
Example of REST API for retrieving literature quotes

## Installation
Application is ready to serve from [Docker client](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). <br>
We use `php8.0-fpm` + `Nginx` + `PostgreSQL` as application services and `Lumen` as framework. <br>

There is `.env.app.example` environment file for development purposes. It contains environment variables both for Docker and Lumen. 
You should rename the `.env.app.example` file to `.env` and set all environment variables as you need. <br>
To start the app, open terminal in your project directory and run:

```shell
docker-compose up
```
